A literal reading of some design patterns would frequently be at odds with this, so it always comes down to judgement - in my opinion, Pythonic beats established design patterns, when in Python. Some design patterns have language assumptions (such as exception-handling being expensive) that contravene the underlying design principles of Python. The one thing that's critical, as all authors agree on, is that **thinking it through it is the key objective**, not your conclusion."

When PHP advocates in the late 2000s saw the damage poor code was doing to the language's reputation (and theirs!), library writers upped the bar high - the core PHP libraries have extremely strong principles around language style, idiom and design patterns.

To start, a concept of \"entities\" is useful: these are conceptual nouns that the domain-expert keeps referring to (also may be thought of as a stakeholder, or client, perhaps). The best way to tease these out is discussion - spot how they use words, what they refer to. The next concept is \"relationships\" - if they are a bridge-building company, they may talk about how many Arches (an entity) a Bridge (another entity) has. You can tell that one *bridge* has many *arches*. Perhaps a *surveyor* periodically \"surveys\" a bridge and \"signs it off\". Finally, there is the business logic: perhaps an application should insist that every *bridge* has an *arch* - this is a business rule - or that a surveyor only signs off a bridge if it is \"structurally sound\"."
