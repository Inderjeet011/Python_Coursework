# Iris Dataset Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using the classic Iris dataset. The script (`iris.py`) implements various machine learning tasks from data loading to model evaluation and prediction.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species:
- **Iris Setosa**
- **Iris Versicolor** 
- **Iris Virginica**

Each flower is described by four features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

## Tasks Implemented

### TASK 1: Data Loading and Preparation
- Downloads the Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Loads data into a pandas DataFrame
- Adds meaningful column names
- Displays dataset information (shape, first few rows, data types)
- Randomizes data to prevent bias in train/test split

### TASK 2: Data Visualization
Creates two types of visualizations:

1. **Scatter Matrix Plot** (`iris_scatter_matrix.png`)
   - Shows relationships between all feature pairs
   - Includes histograms on the diagonal
   - Color-coded by species for easy identification

2. **RadViz Plot** (`iris_radviz.png`)
   - Radial visualization showing how well features separate the classes
   - Useful for understanding feature importance and class separability

### TASK 3: Data Preparation and Splitting
- Prepares features (X) and target variable (y)
- Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
- Uses stratified sampling to maintain class distribution
- Sets random state for reproducibility

### TASK 4: Model Training and Evaluation
- Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with linear kernel
- Performs 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Evaluates model performance on the test set
- Reports accuracy scores
